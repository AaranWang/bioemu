This is the main model 'BioEmu' used to generate results in the paper https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.05.626885v1.abstract

The checkpoint is named 'finetuned-amber-dg' since it has been finetuned on molecular dynamics data from Amber force fields, plus free energy (dG) measurements.
